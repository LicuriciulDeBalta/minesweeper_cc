# minesweeper_cc
A project to help me practice python. 
Composed of two files, the main "minesweeper.py" containing the game, and the header "matrix.py" housing all function bodies.
The code for the main file consists in player input taking and validation, as well as calls to the functions which build and update the mine field. 
The code for the header file fulfils the same functionality as the original game, namely: generating mines, numbers, revealing spaces, revealing the matrix to the user. The code is split between that aimed at "matrix", the board containing all the mines and numbers, and "matrix_ui", a second board that serves as the interface in the console.
